# Snippet Improvement Guide: Matching Query Intent

**Goal:** Double CTR by making titles and descriptions answer the question implied by the query.

---

## The Problem

From your GSC data:
- **Overall CTR:** 0.39%
- **Many queries rank but don't get clicked**
- **Weak CTR = snippet doesn't match user intent**

---

## The Solution

**Make snippets:**
1. Answer the question implied by the query
2. Pre-qualify the reader
3. Match the page role (AUTHORITY vs CONVERSION)

---

## Title Patterns by Query Intent

### Conceptual Queries → Authority Pages

**Query:** "neural" (42 impressions, 0% CTR)

**Bad Title:**
```
Neural Command — AI SEO Services
```

**Good Title:**
```
What is Neural SEO? LLM Visibility Explained
```

**Why:** Answers "what is" directly, signals education not sales

---

### Evaluative Queries → Bridge Pages

**Query:** "generative engine optimization new york" (22 impressions, 0% CTR)

**Bad Title:**
```
GEO Services in New York | Neural Command
```

**Good Title:**
```
GEO vs Traditional SEO: When It Makes Sense in New York
```

**Why:** Addresses comparison/evaluation, pre-qualifies with "when it makes sense"

---

### Transactional Queries → Service Pages

**Query:** "answer engine optimization services new york" (10 impressions, 0% CTR)

**Bad Title:**
```
Answer Engine Optimization | Neural Command
```

**Good Title:**
```
AEO Services for New York Businesses Ready to Dominate AI Search
```

**Why:** States who it's for, signals confidence not education

---

## Description Patterns

### Authority Pages

**Pattern:** Signal learning, not buying

**Example:**
```
Learn how LLM visibility works and why it differs from traditional SEO. 
Research and insights on AI search, citation behavior, and answer engine optimization.
```

**Key phrases:**
- "Learn how..."
- "Research and insights..."
- "Understanding..."
- "Explore..."

**Avoid:**
- "Hire us..."
- "Get started..."
- "Contact us..."

---

### Bridge Pages (HYBRID)

**Pattern:** Insight → implication → optional next step

**Example:**
```
Understanding when AI SEO makes sense and when it doesn't. 
How it impacts AI visibility and search results. 
Learn how our services can help.
```

**Key structure:**
1. Address the doubt/question
2. Explain the implication
3. Optional: gentle service mention

---

### Service Pages (CONVERSION)

**Pattern:** Who it's for + What changes + Why trust

**Example:**
```
For businesses ready to dominate AI search. Get cited in ChatGPT, 
Google AI Overviews, and AI search results. Case studies and proven methodology.
```

**Key structure:**
1. "For [who]..."
2. "[Outcome]..."
3. "[Proof/Trust signal]..."
