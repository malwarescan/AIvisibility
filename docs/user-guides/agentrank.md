## FAQ

### How accurate are the ranking predictions?
The tool uses advanced algorithms and historical data to provide highly accurate predictions. Accuracy varies by platform, but typically exceeds 75% for major AI platforms.

### Can I analyze multiple pieces of content at once?
Currently, the tool analyzes one piece of content at a time for detailed, comprehensive results. For multiple pieces, run separate analyses and compare results.

### How often should I check ranking predictions?
We recommend weekly analysis for active content and monthly for established content. The tool provides alerts for significant ranking changes.

### What's the difference between predicted rank and confidence?
Predicted rank is the expected ranking position, while confidence reflects our certainty in the prediction. High confidence with low rank means we're confident you'll rank poorly.

### Can I export ranking data for external analysis?
Yes! The tool provides multiple export formats including CSV, JSON, and PDF reports for further analysis and team collaboration.
