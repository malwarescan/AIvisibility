# Batch Authority Analyzer - User Documentation

## Overview

The Batch Authority Analyzer is a powerful comparative analysis tool within the Neural Command platform that allows you to analyze multiple domains simultaneously to identify authority gaps and optimization opportunities. This tool provides comprehensive competitive analysis and helps you understand how your content performs against competitors across AI search platforms.

## Purpose

The Batch Authority Analyzer serves as your competitive intelligence companion, helping you:

- **Compare multiple domains** simultaneously for comprehensive competitive analysis
- **Identify authority gaps** between your content and top-performing competitors
- **Discover optimization opportunities** based on competitor strengths and weaknesses
- **Track competitive positioning** across multiple AI search platforms
- **Generate actionable insights** for improving your authority signals
- **Export comparative data** for team collaboration and reporting

## Core Algorithm

The tool employs a sophisticated batch analysis algorithm:

```typescript
interface BatchAnalysis {
  domains: {
    [domain: string]: {
      authority: number;           // 0-100 authority score
      backlinks: number;          // Quality backlink count
      citations: number;          // Citation frequency
      trustScore: number;         // Trustworthiness rating
      recommendations: string[];  // Optimization suggestions
    };
  };
  comparison: {
    topPerformer: string;         // Highest scoring domain
    gaps: string[];              // Authority gaps identified
    opportunities: string[];      // Optimization opportunities
  };
}
```

## AI Prompt

The tool uses advanced AI prompts for comparative analysis:

```
You are analyzing multiple domains for authority comparison.

Domains: {domainList}

For each domain, evaluate:
1. Authority score (0-100)
2. Backlink profile strength
3. Citation frequency
4. Trust signals
5. Competitive advantages

Provide:
- Individual domain analysis
- Comparative insights
- Optimization priorities
- Actionable recommendations

Format as structured comparison with specific metrics.
```

## FAQ

### How many domains can I analyze at once?
The Batch Authority Analyzer can handle 3-10 domains per analysis session. For larger comparative studies, you can run multiple batch analyses and combine the results.

### How accurate are the comparative scores?
The tool uses multiple data sources and AI analysis to provide highly accurate comparative scores. However, authority signals can change over time, so regular analysis is recommended.

### Can I save batch analysis results?
Yes! You can export batch analysis results in CSV or JSON format for future reference and team collaboration.

### How often should I run batch analysis?
We recommend monthly batch analysis for established sites and weekly for competitive markets. This helps track competitive changes and identify new opportunities.

### What if some domains fail to analyze?
The tool includes robust error handling and will continue analyzing other domains even if some fail. Failed domains can be retried individually.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Benchmarking
Set custom benchmarks based on your industry, niche, or specific competitors for more relevant comparative analysis.

### Historical Comparison
Compare current batch results with previous analyses to track competitive changes over time.

### Automated Monitoring
Set up automated batch analysis schedules to monitor competitive changes without manual intervention.

### Team Collaboration
Share batch analysis results with team members and stakeholders for collaborative optimization planning.
