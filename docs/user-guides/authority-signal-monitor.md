# Authority Signal Monitor - User Documentation

## Overview

The Authority Signal Monitor is a specialized tool within the Neural Command platform that helps content creators and SEO professionals optimize their content's authority signals for AI search engines. Using Google's E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) framework, this tool provides comprehensive analysis and actionable recommendations to improve visibility across AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

## Purpose

The Authority Signal Monitor serves as your AI search authority optimization companion, helping you:

- **Monitor E-A-T signals** across 20+ AI platforms in real-time
- **Identify authority gaps** that may be limiting your AI search visibility
- **Receive actionable recommendations** for improving expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness
- **Track competitive positioning** against top-performing content in your niche
- **Optimize for AI-specific ranking factors** that traditional SEO tools miss

## Core Algorithm

The Authority Signal Monitor employs a sophisticated multi-factor analysis algorithm:

```typescript
interface AuthorityAnalysis {
  expertise: {
    score: number;           // 0-100 expertise rating
    signals: string[];       // Specific expertise indicators found
    recommendations: string[]; // How to improve expertise
  };
  authoritativeness: {
    score: number;           // 0-100 authority rating
    backlinks: number;       // Quality backlink count
    citations: number;       // Citation frequency
    domainAge: number;       // Domain age in years
  };
  trustworthiness: {
    score: number;           // 0-100 trust rating
    sslStatus: boolean;      // SSL certificate status
    privacyPolicy: boolean;  // Privacy policy presence
    contactInfo: boolean;    // Contact information availability
  };
}
```

## AI Prompt

The tool uses advanced AI prompts to analyze your content:
