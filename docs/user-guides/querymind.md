    [category: string]: {
      probability: number;           // 0-100 probability score
      impact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
      timeframe: string;            // Expected timeframe
      confidence: number;           // 0-100 confidence level
    };
  };
  opportunities: {
    [opportunity: string]: {
      description: string;          // Opportunity description
      probability: number;          // 0-100 probability
      effort: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
      roi: number;                 // Expected return on investment
    };
  };
  insights: {
    predictions: string[];         // Key predictions
    recommendations: string[];     // Strategic recommendations

## FAQ

### How accurate are the 6-month predictions?
The tool uses advanced machine learning and statistical models to provide highly accurate predictions. Historical accuracy rates typically exceed 80%, but predictions should be used as guidance rather than guarantees.

### Can I customize the forecasting categories?
Yes! You can select specific categories and trends to focus on based on your industry, niche, or strategic priorities.

### How often should I update my forecasts?
We recommend monthly forecast updates for active campaigns and quarterly updates for strategic planning. The tool provides alerts for significant trend changes.

### What's the difference between probability and confidence?
Probability indicates how likely a trend is to occur, while confidence reflects our certainty in the prediction. High confidence with low probability means we're certain the trend won't happen.

### Can I export forecast data for external analysis?
Yes! The tool provides multiple export formats including CSV, JSON, and PDF reports for further analysis and team collaboration.
