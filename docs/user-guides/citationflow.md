## Core Algorithm

The tool employs a sophisticated citation analysis algorithm:

```typescript
interface CitationAnalysis {
  currentCitations: {
    count: number;              // Current citation count
    quality: number;            // 0-100 citation quality score
    platforms: string[];        // Platforms where cited
  };
  opportunities: {
    [platform: string]: {
      probability: number;      // 0-100 citation probability
      effort: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
      expectedImpact: number;  // Expected citation impact
    };
  };
  optimization: {
    strategies: string[];       // Citation optimization strategies
    timeline: string[];         // Implementation timeline
    expectedResults: string[];  // Expected citation results
  };
}
```
