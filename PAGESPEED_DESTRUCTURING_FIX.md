# PageSpeed Destructuring Error Fix

## Issue
The application was throwing an error: `Cannot destructure property 'pageSpeed' of 'apiData' as it is undefined.`

## Root Cause
Multiple files were using unsafe destructuring of `apiData` without checking if it was defined first:

```javascript
// ❌ Unsafe destructuring
const { pageSpeed, ssl, content } = apiData;
```

This would fail when `apiData` was undefined or null.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/app/tools/authority/page.tsx`
- Fixed 4 instances of unsafe destructuring
- Lines: 157, 288, 430, 494

### 2. `src/app/tools/analytics/page.tsx`
- Fixed 1 instance of unsafe destructuring
- Line: 82

### 3. `src/lib/analysis/EnhancedAuthorityService.ts`
- Fixed 2 instances of unsafe destructuring
- Lines: 79, 293

## Solution Applied
Replaced unsafe destructuring with safe alternatives using optional chaining and fallbacks:

```javascript
// ✅ Safe destructuring with fallbacks
const pageSpeed = apiData?.pageSpeed || {};
const ssl = apiData?.ssl || {};
const content = apiData?.content || {};
```

## Benefits
1. **Error Prevention**: No more crashes when `apiData` is undefined
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Application continues to work with fallback values
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All components now handle missing data safely
4. **Better User Experience**: Users see meaningful results instead of errors

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
- Authority analysis works even with incomplete API responses
- Analytics tool handles missing data gracefully
- Enhanced authority service continues to function
- Batch analysis processes work reliably

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All unsafe destructuring has been replaced with safe alternatives
