      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        If your website isn't appearing in AI answers, ChatGPT responses, or Google AI Overviews, you're missing out on massive traffic opportunities. 
        Here's how to diagnose and fix AI visibility issues.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Common Reasons Your Site Isn't in AI Answers</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">1. Lack of Structured Data</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AI systems rely heavily on structured data to understand your content. Without proper schema markup, AI can't easily parse and cite your information.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Missing FAQPage schema for question-answer content</li>
        <li>No Article schema for blog posts and guides</li>
        <li>Missing Organization schema for business information</li>
        <li>Lack of HowTo schema for step-by-step guides</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Poor Content Structure</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AI systems need clear, well-organized content to understand and cite. Poor structure makes it difficult for AI to extract meaningful information.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Unclear headings and subheadings</li>
        <li>Content buried in long paragraphs</li>
        <li>Missing direct answers to common questions</li>
        <li>Lack of bullet points and lists</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Low Domain Authority</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AI systems prioritize content from authoritative, trusted sources. New or low-authority domains struggle to get cited in AI responses.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>New domain with no established authority</li>
        <li>Lack of high-quality backlinks</li>
        <li>No industry recognition or certifications</li>
        <li>Missing author credentials and expertise signals</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">4. Thin or Low-Quality Content</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AI systems avoid citing thin, low-value content. They prioritize comprehensive, well-researched resources that provide real value.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Short, shallow content that doesn't answer questions fully</li>
        <li>Outdated or inaccurate information</li>
        <li>Duplicate or spun content</li>
        <li>Lack of original insights or expertise</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">5. Missing AI-Friendly Elements</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        AI systems look for specific content elements that make information easy to understand and cite.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>No FAQ sections addressing common questions</li>
        <li>Missing step-by-step instructions</li>
        <li>Lack of clear definitions and explanations</li>
        <li>No summary or key takeaways sections</li>
      </ul>
