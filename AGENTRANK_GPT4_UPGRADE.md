# AgentRank Tool - GPT-4 Simulation Upgrade

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the AgentRank tool to use real GPT-4 simulation instead of mock data. The tool now provides realistic AI agent responses for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced OpenAIService
**File**: `src/lib/ai/OpenAIService.ts`

#### New Methods Added:
- **`simulateAgentResponse()`** - Main method for agent simulation
- **`analyzeResponseQuality()`** - Private method for response analysis

#### Agent-Specific System Prompts:
```typescript
const systemPrompts = {
  chatgpt: `You are ChatGPT, a helpful AI assistant. Respond to the user's query in a conversational, informative manner. Provide accurate, helpful information with a friendly tone. If the query mentions a specific brand or website, consider how you would naturally reference it in your response.`,
  claude: `You are Claude, an AI assistant that provides thoughtful, well-reasoned answers. Give concise but comprehensive responses. Focus on being helpful and accurate. If the query mentions a specific brand or website, consider how you would naturally reference it.`,
  perplexity: `You are Perplexity AI, which provides citation-backed answers based on web results. Give informative responses with relevant sources. If the query mentions a specific brand or website, consider how you would naturally reference it in your response with appropriate citations.`,
  'google-ai': `You are Google AI, providing helpful search results and information. Give clear, accurate responses with relevant context. If the query mentions a specific brand or website, consider how you would naturally reference it in your search results.`
}
```

#### Response Quality Analysis:
- Analyzes response relevance, accuracy, and helpfulness
- Provides confidence scores (0-100)
- Generates realistic source suggestions
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for efficient analysis

### 2. Updated API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/tools/agentrank/queryAgent/route.ts`

#### Key Changes:
- **Replaced mock data** with real GPT-4 calls
- **Added OpenAI service integration**
- **Enhanced response structure** with quality metrics
- **Improved ranking calculation** based on actual scores

#### New Response Structure:
```typescript
{
  response: string;           // Real GPT-4 generated response
  score: number;             // Quality score (0-100)
  confidence: number;        // Confidence level (0-1)
  sources: Array<{           // Suggested sources
    url: string;
    title: string;
  }>;
  responseTime: number;      // Actual API response time
  tokens: number;           // Token usage
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Features

#### Real-Time Agent Simulation:
- **ChatGPT**: Conversational, friendly responses
- **Claude**: Thoughtful, well-reasoned answers
- **Perplexity**: Citation-backed responses
- **Google AI**: Search-focused information

#### Quality Metrics:
- **Response Quality Score**: 0-100 based on relevance and accuracy
- **Confidence Level**: 0-1 indicating response reliability
- **Source Suggestions**: Realistic source URLs and titles
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and token usage

#### Ranking Algorithm:
- **Score-based ranking**: Higher quality responses get better rankings
- **Dynamic calculation**: `ranking = max(1, min(10, round(11 - (score / 10))))`
- **Real-time updates**: Rankings reflect actual response quality

## Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Integration
```typescript
// Initialize OpenAI service
const openAIService = new OpenAIService();

// Simulate agent response
const agentResponse = await openAIService.simulateAgentResponse(
  query, 
  agent as 'chatgpt' | 'claude' | 'perplexity' | 'google-ai'
);
```

### Error Handling
- **Fallback responses** when OpenAI is unavailable
- **Graceful degradation** to mock data
- **Comprehensive error logging**
- **User-friendly error messages**

### Performance Optimization
- **Response caching** for repeated queries
- **Token usage tracking** for cost management
- **Response time monitoring** for performance
- **Efficient API calls** with proper timeouts

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Realistic Responses
- **Agent-specific personalities** and response styles
- **Context-aware responses** that consider brand mentions
- **Natural language generation** with proper formatting
- **Source citations** for Perplexity-style responses

### 2. Enhanced Metrics
- **Real confidence scores** based on response quality
- **Accurate response times** from actual API calls
- **Token usage tracking** for cost transparency
- **Quality-based rankings** instead of random numbers

### 3. Better Insights
- **Actionable recommendations** based on real analysis
- **Platform-specific optimization** suggestions
- **Performance trends** with real data
- **Source quality assessment**
