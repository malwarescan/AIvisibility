## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure: `src/app/tools/schema-optimizer/page.tsx`

#### Core Interfaces:
```typescript
interface SchemaImprovement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  targetQuery: string;
  improvement: string;
  impact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  applied: boolean;
  originalValue?: any;
  newValue?: any;
  path?: string;
}
```

#### Key State Management:
```typescript
const [targetQuery, setTargetQuery] = useState('');
const [isGeneratingRecommendations, setIsGeneratingRecommendations] = useState(false);
const [schemaImprovements, setSchemaImprovements] = useState<SchemaImprovement[]>([]);
const [showRecommendations, setShowRecommendations] = useState(false);
```

### API Enhancement: `/api/schema-optimize/route.ts`

#### New Action Handlers:
```typescript
switch (action) {
  case 'generate-improvements':
    return await generateImprovements(originalSchema, targetQuery, targetPlatforms);
  case 'validate':
    return await validateSchema(originalSchema);
  case 'apply-fix':
    return await applyFix(originalSchema, fix);
  case 'apply-all-fixes':
    return await applyAllFixes(originalSchema, fixes);
  default:
    return await optimizeSchema(originalSchema, optimizationGoal, targetPlatforms);
}
```

## Improvement Generation Algorithm

### 1. Query Analysis
```typescript
const generateImprovements = async (schema: any, targetQuery: string, platforms: string[]) => {

### 3. Path-Based Schema Updates
```typescript
const applyImprovement = async (improvement: SchemaImprovement) => {
  // Deep clone current schema
  // Navigate to target path
  // Apply new value
  // Update schema state
  // Mark as applied
};
```
