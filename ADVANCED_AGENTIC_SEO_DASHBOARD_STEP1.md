# Agentic SEO Dashboard — Step 1: Next-Gen UI Scaffold

## Overview
This step implements the full visual scaffold for a next-generation Agentic SEO Dashboard, merging Apple’s minimalist precision with Google’s structured clarity. The UI is built entirely with Tailwind CSS and @tailwindcss/typography, designed for technical SEOs and engineers.

## Layout & Structure
- **Fixed Sidebar Navigation:**
  - Sticky, left-aligned sidebar with platform logo and quick links to all dashboard modules.
- **Hero Header:**
  - Apple/Google-inspired hero with animated gradient, platform logo, and a concise value proposition.
- **Dashboard Grid:**
  - Four feature cards, each a self-contained module:
    1. **Agentic Parser:** Schema readability simulation with JSON-LD input, parse button, code viewer, and simulated parse tree.
    2. **Rich Result Tracker:** URL input, check button, and a dynamic table for Google feature detection with status indicators.
    3. **Structured Data Diff Tool:** Dual schema input, compare button, and a diff viewer styled for code changes.
    4. **AI Visibility Scoreboard:** KPI summary row and Chart.js-compatible chart container.

## Styling & Design System
- **Tailwind Utility Classes Only:** No external UI libraries.
- **Consistent Spacing:** `p-8`, `mb-8`, `gap-6`, `rounded-2xl` for all cards.
- **Typography:** `text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900` for hero, `text-2xl font-bold` for module titles, `prose` for content.
- **Backgrounds:** `bg-gray-50`, `bg-white`, `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50`.
- **Status Indicators:** Subtle greens for success, muted reds for warnings, blue gradients for interactive elements.
- **Component Isolation:** Each module is a clean, reusable card with clear separation.

## Developer-First Philosophy
- No marketing fluff; all modules are technical and actionable.
- Minimal DOM, fast rendering, and clear focus on performance and clarity.
- Accessibility and responsiveness are built-in via Tailwind’s utility classes.

## Next Steps
- Wire up interactivity for each module (parsing, feature detection, diffing, chart data).
- Integrate real data sources and backend APIs as needed.
- Add animated transitions and micro-interactions for further polish.
